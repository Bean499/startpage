[Live Preview](https://bean499.github.io/startpage/) - Note that colours and art will be broken in this preivew mode, since it can't import any from pywal or the `art` folder.

This homepage picks a random image from the folder `art`. These need to manually be added to the list in `art.js`. Feel free to fork and make your own changes!
